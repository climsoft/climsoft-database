# climsoft-database

This repository contains scripts for creating the current version, and previous versions, of the Climsoft initial and test databases.

In development, you usually need to delete the old versions of the databases on your system by right-clicking them and choosing `Drop`.
Then you can create the new version by going to `File` > `Run SQL file`.

If your databases contain data that needs to be kept then you can save a copy of the databases before deleting them by right-clicking
the database and choosing `Export database as SQL`.

(Instructions are for [HeidiSQL](https://www.heidisql.com/) but will be similar when using other database tools)
